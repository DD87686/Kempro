# About
This program uses the uncompiled [elvis972602's Kemono Scraper](https://github.com/elvis972602/Kemono-scraper) written in `Go` and it's just a way to easily use it for the people that don't know how.<br>
This code is safe and free to use, **feel free to inspect it.**<br>
I was bored and the normal program is a little hard to use so i made it more simple to use
# How to use
1. Navigate to the \KEMPRO directory
2. make sure to install the [modules](https://github.com/DD87686/Kempro#modules) for python
3. find the `main.bat` and launch it
4. Go through what it asks you, **Enable the tutorial in the settings.yaml if you're stuck**
5. You're done! Just wait for it to download everything.
# Languages
All of my code was written in [python](https://www.python.org/) with modules (not the kemonoscraper)
# Modules
You need certain python modules for this program to work, some are pre-installed with python but these need to be installed manually, if you know how to use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), these are the commands for the modules that are used:
```
pip install pystyle
pip install pyyaml
```
# Known Issues
1. The [kemono.su](https://kemono.su) site is down
2. Wrong uID
### Found an issue?
File an issue report in the [issues tab](https://github.com/DD87686/Kempro/issues) and i'll try to fix it.
